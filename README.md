# IEBrowser

**IEBrowser** is a tiny browser based on the old MS Internet Explorer 6 Engine. I wrote this utility because I still need to manage some old devices, such as DVR and NVR whose interface is based on the old OCX/ActiveX technology.

## How it works

Internet Explorer is still available on the last Windows 10 releases even if it is not visible on the Start menu. But instead of start it, **IEBrowser** letâ€™s you to save your favourites, in the same manner as Putty, and starts a session in an embedded window with no toolbars, menus and other distractions.
Technically, it is based on the *TWebBrowser* component available in Borland Delphi 7 that acts as a software interface between the application and the *MS IE web engine*.

## How to use
Simply drag the executable where you want and start it. **IEBrowser** is a pure Windows 32 bit application with no other dependencies, except for the IE web engine, of course! It is written in Object Pascal and compiled with Borland Delphi 7. There is no need to perform any kind of installation. All settings are text files saved in the current user's AppData directory.
